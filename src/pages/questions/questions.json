        "question": "Do I need to wash the greens before eating?",
        "answer": [
            "Since we do not use any fertilizers or pesticides our greens do not have to be washed. You can eat them straight out of the container if you would like! If you do wish to wash your greens then we highly recommend only washing the amount you plan on eating for that meal. To elaborate, if you plan on eating half a container of broccoli do not wash all of them at once; only wash the half you plan on eating. This will reduce the moisture content of the microgreens in their container and allow for longer storage."

            "All microgreens varieties are dense in nutrients and it is difficult to say which one would be the healthiest. If we had to choose one, we would say the broccoli microgreens have the most health benefits due to its high sulforaphane content.",
